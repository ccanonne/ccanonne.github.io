# [ü¶ä FOCS 2023](https://focs.computer.org/2023/) Workshop: Algorithmic Aspects of High-Dimensional Probabilistic Models
## Organized by Arnab Bhattacharyya (National University of Singapore) and Cl√©ment Canonne (University of Sydney)

‚è∞ _Dates:_ Nov 6‚Äì7, 2023

High-dimensional probability distributions are currently omnipresent as models for complex data. Probabilistic models are used in an amazingly diverse array of data analysis tasks, from understanding sociological behavior to enabling visual object recognition, speech perception, and natural language comprehension. High-dimensional probabilistic models take various forms: classically-studied models such as multivariate Gaussians and Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graphs, models with roots in statistical physics such as stochastic block models and Ising models, probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, as well as the class of implicit generative models, such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, that have taken the world by storm recently. 

The goal of the proposed workshop is to highlight current trends in research on __algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional probabilistic models__. Specifically, we will focus on recent works that identify __new directions for the TCS community__, so as to encourage newcomers to delve into the important problems in the area. The workshop is particularly timely, as it is increasingly in vogue to be presented with generative models that sample from a distribution _D_, with the goal being to efficiently learn information about _D_. What are rigorous guarantees that can be made when _D_ is high-dimensional and  "complex"? Better understanding of the computational aspects of such questions can  be potentially impactful for a number of areas, e.g., security, machine learning, probabilistic programming, etc.

__Program__: tentative (more details available soon)

The program will feature talks on recent and exciting results in this area, and will gather open problems in the topic from and for the participants:

    <summary>"Indistinguishable Generative Models of Huge Objects"</summary>
    
    #### Abstract:
    In this talk I am going to discuss generative models of huge objects, from the perspective of a recent notion called outcome indistinguishability. In generative models, the goal is to generate a distribution that is similar to a specific input object (or distribution). When the input object is huge and complex and cannot be read entirely, how do we find a generative model for our object? How do we define similarity between our model and the object? In our work, we answer both questions using outcome indistinguishability. In the talk, I am going to explain what outcome indistinguishability is, and how it is helpful in our setting of learning generative models.

    <summary>"Likelihood-free hypothesis testing"</summary>
    
    #### Abstract:
    Modern theoretical models in particle physics, climate modeling etc often provide predictions in the form of extremely complex simulators. Thus, in order to empirically validate such theories a statistician needs to compare an experimental sample against several simulated ones, corresponding to different choices of phenomenological parameters of the theory. This area of work, known under the names of likelihood-free inference (LFI) or simulation-based inference, can be seen as extension of classical two-sample testing to more than two samples. In this talk we will present minimax sample complexities and discover the existence of a tradeoff between the sizes of experimental sample and the simulated ones, in particular showing the possibility of testing hypotheses without estimating densities. As a by-product of this tradeoff we discover (a) a universal relation between the sample complexities of goodness-of-fit (identity) testing and density estimation; (b) new methods for optimal two-sample and indentity testing based on classification accuracy.

    Joint work with Patrik Gerber (MIT) and Yanjun Han (Courant).
