# [ü¶ä FOCS 2023](https://focs.computer.org/2023/) Workshop: Algorithmic Aspects of High-Dimensional Probabilistic Models
## Organized by Arnab Bhattacharyya (National University of Singapore) and Cl√©ment Canonne (University of Sydney)

‚è∞ _Dates:_ Nov 6‚Äì7, 2023

High-dimensional probability distributions are currently omnipresent as models for complex data. Probabilistic models are used in an amazingly diverse array of data analysis tasks, from understanding sociological behavior to enabling visual object recognition, speech perception, and natural language comprehension. High-dimensional probabilistic models take various forms: classically-studied models such as multivariate Gaussians and Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graphs, models with roots in statistical physics such as stochastic block models and Ising models, probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, as well as the class of implicit generative models, such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, that have taken the world by storm recently. 

The goal of the proposed workshop is to highlight current trends in research on __algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional probabilistic models__. Specifically, we will focus on recent works that identify __new directions for the TCS community__, so as to encourage newcomers to delve into the important problems in the area. The workshop is particularly timely, as it is increasingly in vogue to be presented with generative models that sample from a distribution _D_, with the goal being to efficiently learn information about _D_. What are rigorous guarantees that can be made when _D_ is high-dimensional and  "complex"? Better understanding of the computational aspects of such questions can  be potentially impactful for a number of areas, e.g., security, machine learning, probabilistic programming, etc.
