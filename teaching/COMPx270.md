## Content for the COMP4270 and COMP5270 Course on "Randomised and Advanced Algorithms" at the University of Sydney ##
This page will be updated weekly, as the content is written and uploaded. 12 lectures (one chapter per lecture), and one review lecture. Slides will come later.

Each chapter is the basis for a two-hour lecture, and the class is aimed at last-year undergrads and masters of computer science students, without required previous exposure to advanced algorithms. It is not, by design, meant to be comprehensive. Some very nice algorithms _will_ be missing; many important ideas may not make the cut.
